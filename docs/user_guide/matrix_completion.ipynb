    "<h1> What is Matrix Completion? </h1>\n",
    "<p> Simply put, the goal of matrix completion is fill in missing entries of a matrix (or dataset) given the fact that the matrix is low rank, or low dimensional.  Essentially, it's like a game of Sudoku with a different set of rules. Lets say I have a matrix that I know is supposed to be rank 2.  That means that every column can be written as a linear combination (weighted sum) of two vectors.  Lets look at an example of what this puzzle might look like.  </p>\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> The first two columns are completly filled in, so we can use those to figure out the rest of the columns.  Based on the few entries in the third column that are given, we can see that the third column should probably be the first column plus the second column.  Likewise, the fourth column is two times the first column minus the second column. </p>\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p> To see why we should care about this, here's a claim that shouldn't be too hard to believe: <b> Datasets are inherently low rank </b>.  In the example we just did, the columns could be movies, the rows could be people, and the numbers could be how each person rated each movie.  Obviously, this is going to be sparse since not everyone has seen every movie.  That's where matrix completions comes in.  When we filled in the missing entries, we gave our guess as to what movies people are going to enjoy. After explaining an algorithm to do matrix completion, we're going to try this for a data set with a million ratings people gave movies and see how well we recommend movies to people.</p>\n",

    "There's two paradigms for matrix completion.  One is to minimize the rank of a matrix that fits our measurements, and the other is to find a matrix of a given rank that matches up with our known entries.  In this blog post, I'll just be talking about the second.  \n",
