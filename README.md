# SpaLoR: A Python Package for Sparse and Low Rank Machine Learning Methods

SpaLoR is python package for low rank and sparse data science methods, with the goal of making current research on machine learning methods for low-rank and sparse matrices more widely available. Using SpaLoR, you could:
  - Use PCA for matrices that have missing entries
  - Create a predictive model for recomendation systems
  - Identify outliers while doing PCA
  - Use Leverage scores to find the most informative features in you data sets
  - And much more to come!
